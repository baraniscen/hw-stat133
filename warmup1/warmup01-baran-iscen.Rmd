*This section will be dedicated to Myrcella Baratheon.*

She said once:

> Is Bran going to die ?

Here is an image illustrating what Myrcella looks like:

#Cooking Recipe
**We will dedicate this section to the Matzo Ball soup. One must get the following ingredients**:

* 2 parsnips, scrubbed and cut into big chunks
- 3 1/2 to 4 1/2 pounds chicken necks, backs and wings
+ 3 celery ribs, cut into big chunks
* 3 carrots, scrubbed and cut into big chunkss
- 2 onions, unpeeled and quartered
+ 1 head garlic, cut horizontally in half

We will need *"special"* kitchen tools for this:

* Food Hugger Set
- Serving Spoon
+ Himalayan Salt Plank Scrubber Brush
* Kale & Herb Razor
- Spongester 
+ Easy Egg Peeler

**To realize this meal, we will have to follow five steps:**

1. Mix all matzo ball ingredients in a bowl. Cover and place in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.

2. Bring 1 1/2 quarts of well-salted water to a brisk boil in a medium sized pot.

3. Reduce the flame. Run your hands under water so they are thoroughly wet. Form matzo balls by dropping spoonfuls of matzo ball batter approximately 1-inch in diameter into the palm of your wet hands and rolling them loosely into balls. Drop them into the simmering salt water one at a time. Cover the pot and cook them for 30 to 40 minutes.

4. About ten minutes before the matzo balls are ready, bring prepared chicken stock to a simmer with the sliced carrot in it. Ladle some soup and a couple matzo balls into each bowl and top with a couple snips of dill. 

5. Eat immediately.

**There is no special season to eat this meal, although it has a particular flavour thorugh winter. This having been said, considering the fact that there is no real 'winter' in California, one can try the experience whenever he likes!**

#Quadratic Equation

$$ax^2 + bx+c=0$$
$$x = \frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }}{{2a}}$$
$$ax^2 + bx + c=0$$
$$4x^2a^2 + 4abx + 4ac = 0$$
$$4x^2a^2 + 4abx = -4ac$$
$$ 4x^2a^2 + 4abx + b^2 = b^2 - 4ac$$
$$(2ax+b)^2 = b^2 - 4ac $$
$$ 2 ax + b = \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}$$
$$2ax = - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac}$$
$$ x = \frac{{ - b \pm \sqrt {b^2 - 4ac} }}{{2a}} $$

#Comments and Reflections

As explained by the Professor in lecture, the reporting is a decise part of the researcher work. Writing an article is a step, running an experience is something, being able to explain it clearly and in a transparent way is something else. Thus, I appreciate to get to use the different tools available with R and see for example that I can use my LaTeX code.
